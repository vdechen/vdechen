### Hi, there! I'm Vanessa 👋😊

- 🔭 Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been interested in investigations in mystery books, thriller movies, poetry, meditation, philosophy and scientific research. 
- 👥 My background in mental health and different approaches to human functioning (Psychology, Psychoanalysis and Neuropsychology) show my desire to explore and better understand things. 
- 📉 I find it very fulfilling to identify patterns, gain insights and analyze events in new ways, which is why I transitioned to the Data Science field. 
- 🌐 I’m looking forward to collaborating on Data Science and Data Analysis projects!
- ✉️ How to reach me: vanessadechen@gmail.com
